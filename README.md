Matlab code for the journal:

K. Vasudevan, “Turbo Equalization of Serially Concatenated Turbo Codes using a Predictive-DFE based Receiver”, Signal, Image and Video Processing, Springer, vol. 1, no. 3, pp. 239—252, Aug. 2007.

The MATLAB code for the logBCJR algorithm is inspired by the SCILAB code of BCJR algorithm in the probability-domain written by K Vasudevan and can be found at http://home.iitk.ac.in/~vasu
